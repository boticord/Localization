# Introduction

Anyone can contribute to the development of the project. To do this, the following rules must be followed:

## Base

1.  All changes must be clearly described in the commit and pull request.
2.  Be a good person. Don't use profanity and do not insult other members of the project.
3.  Use English as preferred language, because it's an international language

## Branches

-   `main` - primary branch
-   `dev`- development branch

## Commits

There are no clear rules for the commits, but there a few guidelines:

-   Commits preferably should be used in English
-   Use [conventional commits](https://conventionalcommits.org)

### Examples

1.  <strike>Changed text</strike> ❌Commit doesn't describe why and where a text was changed.
2.  **chore(Faq): Added additional answer to the question ** ✅ Perfect!

## Documentation
